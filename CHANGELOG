------------------
Added COPYING.LIB and License line to each module header
(Thanks to Johann von Nepomuk for spotting this huge oversight on my part!)

Changed VBBLOCK based functions in vbLowLevel.c to delay writing back to the
disk files while the index is 'locked' for use.  (Limits the number of system
calls performed.  This *REALLY* has a HUGE impact if ISEXCLLOCK is used!

Implemented variable length row processing
HUGE warning...  This is not 100% compatible with the competition from IBM.
Therefore, if you the bcheck utility from IBM, it *MAY* report issues with the
variable length nodes in the index file.  This is because the IBM product uses
a *STUPID* algorithm for determining which 'group' a variable length node with
some free space left should belong to.  (Namely, IBM appears to have cutoffs at
200bytes, 400bytes, 600bytes and 800bytes.  I have chosen to use a logarithmic
approach instead with cutoffs at 8bytes, 32bytes, 128bytes and 512bytes)
To put it MILDLY, the varlen code should be considered 'UNSTABLE' in this
release.
